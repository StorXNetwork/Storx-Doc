Welcome to the StorX Integration Documentation repository. This repository contains examples and resources to help you integrate with the StorX decentralized cloud storage network.

## About StorX

[StorX](https://storx.io) Networks is an Open Source, Trustless, Censorship Resistant Decentralized Cloud Storage Network, powered by XDC. StorXâ€™s unique architecture empowers its users to store their data with absolute privacy and security. Data uploaded on StorX Network is encrypted by the user's unique passphrase, split into smaller fragments, and these fragments are then replicated and distributed across autonomous storage nodes operated by individual operators spread worldwide.
